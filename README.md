# Just for Fun: Analyzing My Letterboxd Reviews

### Overview: 

In this project, I scraped data from my [Letterboxd account](https://letterboxd.com/arnaoz/) about my movie reviews and analyzed them. Letterboxd is a social networking site for film buffs; it lets you share movie lists, ratings, and reviews with friends. I have been active on the site since January and left more than 60 reviews, which I scraped along with my ratings (out of five) of each movie I reviewed. I cleaned, visualized, and conducted a word frequency and sentiment analysis upon the review data to glean insight about my movie taste. Turns out I am positive about movies! I am so surprised.
